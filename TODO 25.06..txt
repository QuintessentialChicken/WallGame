Focus Right now:
	Fixing core Mechanic (Balancing) and making it fun
	Back to papaer prototype?

Point System rewarding good Players
	
Mooore diegetic UI - Tobi
	- Enemies are carrying flags signaling 10 guys

More Enemy Variety - Tobi
	- more Damage per shot
	- tar pit, slowing down wallther
	- stun if Segment infront is hit (Maybe)
	- Smoke screen

Camera Movement - Leon
	- Smooth slight follow
	- Camera Shake on Event

Upgrade System (Maybe)
	Every night you upgrade on wall Segment to have a permanent upgrade.
	THis is done by chosing betwen 2 (or 3) randomly drawn Upgrades and placing it on the wall.

		Ideas for Upgrades
			- Wall Segment gets more Health
			- Scaffolding gets more Health
			- double attack impact
			- attracting Trebuchet shots to this part that would otherwise hit neighbouring parts
			- redirecting Trebuchet shots to a neighbouring wall Segment
			- slow down Trebuchet
			- Auto repair with cooldown
			- Rebounding trebuchet attacks to the enemy (Massive Damage)
			- better telegraphing of enemy attacks
